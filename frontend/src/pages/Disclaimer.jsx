        <p>You are strongly encouraged to review the publisher's EULA before installation and activation. If the software fails to activate, we will assist you or issue a refund under our <a href="/refund-policy" className="underline">Refund Policy</a>. If the software has bugs, missing features, or fails to protect against a specific threat, that is a matter between you and the publisher.</p>
