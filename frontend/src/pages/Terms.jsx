        <p>Welcome to Garnavo ("we", "us", "our", or "the Company"). These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Customer", "you", "your") and Garnavo governing your access to and use of the website located at <strong>garnavo.com</strong> (the "Site") and any purchases you make through it.</p>
        <p>By accessing the Site, creating an account, submitting an order, or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and by our Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, and Disclaimer, which are incorporated herein by reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Site.</p>

      <Section id="definitions" title="2. Definitions">
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li><strong>"Product"</strong> — a digital license key or activation code for third-party software, primarily Norton, Webroot and McAfee security products.</li>
          <li><strong>"Order"</strong> — a request submitted by you through the Site to purchase one or more Products.</li>
          <li><strong>"License"</strong> — the right, granted by the software publisher, to use the Product for the term and conditions set out by the publisher.</li>
          <li><strong>"Publisher"</strong> — the original software vendor (e.g., Gen Digital Inc. for Norton, OpenText for Webroot, McAfee LLC for McAfee) whose end-user license agreement (EULA) governs your use of the software.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section id="eligibility" title="3. Eligibility">
        <p>You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to place an order with us. By using the Site, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and that you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="products" title="4. Products & services">
        <p>Garnavo is an independent digital software reseller. We source authentic license keys from authorized channels and deliver them electronically to our customers via email. All Products are sold as digital license keys only — <strong>no physical goods are shipped</strong>.</p>
        <p>The use of any Product is subject to the end-user license agreement (EULA) provided by the Publisher. It is your responsibility to review and accept the Publisher's EULA before using the software.</p>
        <p>Product descriptions, features, device counts, and subscription lengths are provided by us based on publicly available Publisher information. We do our best to ensure accuracy, but we do not warrant that all descriptions are current, complete, or error-free. In the event of a discrepancy, the Publisher's terms control.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="pricing" title="5. Pricing & payment">
        <p>All prices are displayed in U.S. Dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated and are exclusive of applicable taxes, which will be calculated at checkout where required by law. Prices are subject to change without notice; however, once an Order is confirmed, the price displayed at the time of purchase will apply.</p>
        <p>Payment is processed securely through <strong>PayPal, Inc.</strong> We do not store or have access to your full payment card or bank account details. By submitting an Order, you authorize us and PayPal to charge your selected payment method for the total Order amount.</p>
        <p>If a payment is declined, delayed, or reversed (including chargebacks), we reserve the right to suspend or cancel the corresponding Order and revoke any License keys already delivered.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="orders" title="6. Order process & digital delivery">
        <p>After you complete checkout, your Order enters a "pending" state until payment is confirmed. Our activation team reviews each Order for fraud and payment verification. Once verified, we deliver your License key(s) via email to the address you provided.</p>
        <p><strong>Expected delivery time: 5–15 minutes after payment confirmation.</strong> In rare cases — such as high-fraud-risk transactions, incomplete details, or outside business hours — delivery may take up to 24 hours. If your key has not arrived within 24 hours, please check your spam folder and then contact us.</p>
        <p>It is your responsibility to provide a valid, accessible email address at checkout. We are not responsible for delivery failures caused by incorrect email addresses, aggressive spam filters, or full inboxes.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="activation" title="7. License activation & use">
        <p>To activate your License, you must sign in to the Publisher's activation portal (e.g., my.norton.com, webroot.com/safe, or mcafee.com/activate) and enter the product key we deliver. Activation service is available through our Activation Portal at <a href="/activation" className="underline">garnavo.com/activation</a>.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for complying with the Publisher's EULA, including all restrictions on the number of devices, geographic use, personal vs. commercial use, and prohibitions on transfer or resale of the License.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="refunds" title="8. Refunds & cancellations">
        <p>Refunds are governed by our <a href="/refund-policy" className="underline">Refund Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference. In summary, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for Licenses that fail to activate through no fault of the customer. Fully activated Licenses are non-refundable except where required by applicable consumer protection law.</p>
