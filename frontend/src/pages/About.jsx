      <Section id="mission" title="Our mission">
        <p>Garnavo was founded on a simple idea: <strong>cybersecurity should be affordable and easy to access for everyone.</strong></p>
        <p>Retail-priced antivirus subscriptions have become expensive, and the checkout experience on many publisher sites is designed to upsell — not to serve. We built Garnavo to give consumers a straightforward alternative: legitimate license keys for leading antivirus brands, at fair prices, delivered by email within minutes, backed by responsive customer service if anything goes wrong.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section id="story" title="Our story">
        <p>Garnavo was founded in Hayward, California by a small team of software resellers and customer-experience professionals who had spent years watching friends and family struggle with confusing renewal notices, surprise price increases, and overwhelming installer flows for major security products.</p>
        <p>We sourced our first inventory of genuine keys from trusted digital channels and started small — one product, one delivery flow, one email contact inbox. Today, we carry three of the most trusted names in consumer security — Norton, Webroot and McAfee — spanning antivirus, internet security suites, VPN, identity protection and more, and we serve customers worldwide.</p>

      <Section id="how-we-work" title="How we work">
        <p>We are a lean company. Every dollar we don't spend on advertising or overhead is a dollar we can pass back to customers as lower prices. Our operational focus is on three things: sourcing genuine license inventory, keeping the buying experience simple, and answering inquiries within hours (not days).</p>
        <p>All orders are personally reviewed by our activation team before delivery. This step catches fraud early and ensures every customer receives a working key. It is why we can offer a 30-day money-back guarantee with confidence.</p>
